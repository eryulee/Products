## API and Data Sample

Show us a snippet of JSON returned by your Airtable (you can find it under the API documentation) so we know you can access it and get the info you need. This __must__ be properly formatted. An example is below:

```json
{
    "records": [
       {
            "id": "rec1wqGxkcVC1VByq",
            "fields": {
                "category": "Diapers",
                "brand": "Huggies ",
                "name": "littler snugglers",
                "rating": 4,
                "review": "pretty good. sizing is off though."
            },
            "createdTime": "2021-08-20T17:37:20.000Z"
        },
       
```

### MVP/PostMVP

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MVP and PostMVP.  Carefully decide what is placed into your MVP, as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP 


- Use filter method to filter category 
- Render data on page
- Reuse form for both post and put request


#### PostMVP  

-Allow user to save favorites
- Add start rating system
- Use local storage to save user favorites
- make a separate 'Form' component
